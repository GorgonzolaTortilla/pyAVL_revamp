AIRFOILS:   AVL refuses to recognize airfoils that contain an 'e' in their header,
            probably cause it misinterprets it as an exponent. XFOIL doesn't have
            this problem, so I have no idea what's going on. AVL claims that it
            can use airfoil .dat files created from XFOIL's SAVE command, but 
            this does not work if the airfoil header has an 'e' in it. 

            Furthermore, airfoil file names are NOT case sensitive.

            

PLANES:     Each plane has a folder, with its .avl, .run, and .mass files. The .avl file should always have the same
            name as the folder.
