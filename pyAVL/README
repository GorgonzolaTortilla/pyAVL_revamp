LOL AINT NOTHIN IN HERE ðŸ’€ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

I put imports inline instead of at the top of files, so don't freak out when there's imports 
randomly put into the files. I found that there's no difference, so I tried to go back through the code
and put all imports at the top, but there may be a few stragglers left behind. Please also know
that I have yet to work on this library at a reasonable time of day with less than 400 mg of caffeine
in my body.
